# Pyspark_Practice

# Overview

This repository contains projects where PySpark is used to process and analyze data stored in PostgreSQL (accessed via pgAdmin). The projects focus on real-world business scenarios, including Employee Sales Analysis, Customer Churn Analysis, and E-commerce Sales Analysis.

# Technologies Used

PySpark: For distributed data processing

PostgreSQL: As the database for storing structured data

pgAdmin: For managing and querying PostgreSQL

Jupyter Notebook/PyCharm: For executing PySpark scripts


# Datasets & Analysis

1. Employee Sales Analysis

Extracted employee sales data from PostgreSQL

Performed data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation using PySpark

Analyzed sales performance trends, top-performing employees, and revenue insights

2. Customer Churn Analysis

Retrieved customer transaction data from PostgreSQL

Used PySpark for Analyzing the churn rate

3. E-commerce Sales Analysis

Processed large-scale sales transaction data using PySpark

Identified top-selling products, seasonal trends, and revenue patterns

Optimized queries to improve performance in PostgreSQL

# Installation & Setup

1. Clone the Repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>

2. Set Up the Virtual Environment (Optional):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies:

pip install pyspark psycopg2 pandas matplotlib

# Configure PostgreSQL Connection:

  # Update the database credentials in the script:

db_properties = {
    "user": "your_username",
    "password": "your_password",
    "driver": "org.postgresql.Driver"
}
jdbc_url = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database"
